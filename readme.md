# MISTI AIMS 2024
### Australian Insitute of Marine Science
### Andrew Motz
### June - August 2024

## Overview
This is a repositiory with the files and documentation of my MISTI internship with the Australian Institute of Marine Science. This contains the python files, overleaf PDFs, and markdown writeups of things I did to the best of my ability and patience to document them. Not all files I worked on are here. Several are on MATLAB Online and many more are CAD files that I have not decided the best way to archive. They will most likely be added to \\Pearl\techdev\Engineering once I decide what an appropriate organization is.

Each subfolder contains a ReadMe file with a much more detailed explanation of the activities undertaken and the files provided.

## Contents
The projects I worked on are:
1) Thermal Modeling and Design Considerations for Electronics Housings
2) Data Analysis from ReefScan Deep and Altitude Keeping Control
3) Suction Anchor Removal Force Modeling
