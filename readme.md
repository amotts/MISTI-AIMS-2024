# MISTI AIMS 2024
### Australian Insitute of Marine Science

### June - August 2024

## Overview
This is a repositiory with the files and documentation of my MISTI internship with the Australian Institute of Marine Science. This contains the python and ROS files, overleaf PDFs, and markdown writeups of things I did to the best of my ability and patience to document them. Not all files I worked on are here. Several are on MATLAB Online and many more are CAD files and FEA files. The relevant and most recent version have been uploaded to \\pearl\techdev\Engineering\MIT Interns 2024\Andrew\Documents.

Each subfolder contains a ReadMe file with a much more detailed explanation of the activities undertaken and the files provided.

## Contents
The projects I worked on are:
1) **[Thermal Modeling and Design Considerations for Electronics Housings](Thermal)**
2) **[Data Analysis from ReefScan Deep and Altitude Keeping Control](ReefScanDeep_Altitude)**
3) **[Suction Anchor Removal Force Modeling](Anchor_Suction)**

I have done my best get in the habit of providing thorough documentation on what the files are, how to use them, and my thought processes but I am sure that I have missed some key elements. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions. My email is amotz@mit.edu and Dev can share my phone number.
