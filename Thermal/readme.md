# Thermal Modeling Project

## Overview
The goal of this project was to understand the heat dissipation from the underwater housing of the ReefScan platforms to inform the design of future electronics housings. Heat is generated by the electronics operating in the air-tight housing. That heat must be dissipated into the surrounding sea water while maintaining an internal temperature that is within the operating limits of the electronics components. This project was proposed by Dev but transitioned to be primarily working with Trevor.

## Method
Initial modeling was primarily documented in the series of PDFs titled "Aims_Thermal_Study" 1-5. A simple resistance model was used to find the steady state temperature expected from the conduction and convection involved in dissipating the heat. Calculations for this were performed primarily in MATLAB online. In conjunction, data was pulled from log files from operations of the ReefScan Transom and plotted over time. This data was plotted using [Thermal Graphing](ThermalGraphing.py). From there, adjustments were made to the modeling coefficents to attempt to better match the experimental data. A brief early attempt at matching in the time domain was made using the ODE solver function in [Thermal Differential Graph](ThermalDifferentialGraph.py).

At this point it was clear that additional methods were necessary to dissipate heat. A radially expaning clamp to hold components to the inside of the housing directly with aluminium was prototyped in Inventor and adjusted for production. (Update if/when prototype is produced).

After consultation with Trevor, a heat pipe from the electronics to the end cap was selected as the likely method forward. From modeling, the endcap was not sufficient to dissipate the full amount of heat without reaching a temperature close to if not exceeding the limit of 65 \degree C. New designs for incoperating fins were modeled in Inventor and FEA performed to evaluate structural and thermal performance.
